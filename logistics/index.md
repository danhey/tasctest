## Posters and talks

#### Oral presentations

The talk schedule has now been [published](https://tasc.ifa.hawaii.edu/program). If you are scheduled for a talk and will not be able to present in-person please contact the LOC (tasc7@hawaii.edu) as soon as possible. Talks will be held in the UH Mānoa Art Auditorium.

Invited talks are **20 minutes for the presentation + 10 minutes for questions**. Contributed talk lengths are 12 minutes for the presentation + 3 minutes for questions. The auditorium projector supports widescreen **16:9** format. Presentations can be in Powerpoint, Keynote and PDF format and will be presented from a single conference-supplied laptop. The LOC will supply a link to upload your presentations. Presentations should be uploaded no later than 30 minutes before the start of your session.

The Zoom webinar link for the daily talks will be made available through our online communications platform. All sessions will be recorded, and recordings will be made available on TASOC after the conference has ended.

#### Posters

**Online posters** will be presented on the online platform. We are also planning to project online posters on a screen in the physical poster rooms. Online posters should be prepared as a single slide in Powerpoint, Keynote or PDF format. The LOC will supply a link to upload online posters.

**Physical posters** will be presented on the second floor of the UH Mānoa Campus Center, which is a short walk from the auditorium. Posters can be mounted starting from 7am on Monday July 17 and need to be removed by 5pm Friday July 21. Posters should have a maximum size of 841 x 1189 mm or 33.1 x 46.8 inches (A0 format). Smaller sizes are acceptable. In-person participants will have the opportunity to give a single-slide 1-minute presentation in the poster sparkler sessions, which are scheduled before the poster sessions on Tuesday and Thursday. The LOC will supply a sign-up sheet for poster sparklers closer to the conference. Physical posters will also appear online.

## Online platform and live-streaming

The online platform for the conference will be Zulip, which is a free, open-source alternative to Slack that allows for efficient archiving. Zulip can be accessed through a web browser or by downloading the app from the website. You will receive emails with your personal registration link (if you cannot find it or have trouble signing up, please reach out to the LOC).  Please do not share your link with non-registered participants.

The Zulip platform contains streams, which are equivalent to Slack channels. The default streams for each user include talks for each day of the conference, posters, announcements, and a stream to ask questions to the LOC, among others. Feel free to join any of the other optional streams (e.g. dedicated streams for working groups), or to create private streams for collaborative discussions.

Oral presentations in the auditorium will be live-streamed through a Zoom webinar. Links will be made available on Zulip prior to the start of each day. Online participants will be able to ask questions either through Zulip or the Zoom Webinar Q&A feature.

## Accomodation

Temperatures in Honolulu in July can reach ~87F/30C, but the island often has strong breezes (many personal residences in the valley have no A/C or heating at all!).
