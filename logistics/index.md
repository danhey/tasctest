## Accomodation

### On-campus housing

On campus housing is available at the [Lincoln Hall at East-West Center (EWC)](https://www.eastwestcenter.org/campus/housing/housing-facilities/lincoln-hall). Lincoln Hall is within a few minutes walk from the conference venue. Please be aware that this is inexpensive (for Hawaiʻi), no-frills accommodation and that the rooms are not air conditioned. Temperatures in Honolulu in July can reach ~87F/30C, but the island often has strong breezes (many personal residences in the valley have no A/C or heating at all!).


### Requesting conference-reserved on-campus housing

On-campus housing reserved by conference must be requested through an online form and will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Attendees who apply for on-campus housing must pay a 2 night room security deposit to hold a room.
