## Hiking on Oʻahu
There are numerous state-maintained trails accessible in Mānoa Valley, as well as further afield via car or bus. Official trails can be found [here](https://hawaiitrails.hawaii.gov/trails/#/). Be prepared for strong sun and rain on all hikes regardless of the weather forecast, and be aware that most hikes are steep and can be very slippery when wet. The hikes on Oʻahu have a much larger range of difficulties than typical hikes you may have encountered in the western US, so it’s worth checking websites like alltrails.com for crowd-sourced reviews and advice on conditions. The hikes listed here are local favorites but also have minimal exposure. 

**Note that many of the following sites are sacred to Native Hawaiians.** Sacred places in Hawaii are places with significant historical and cultural meaning. At many of these sacred places important historic events, such as the births of kings and other major events took place in the past. Today, these places are considered a very important part of Hawaiian culture. Please be respectful of these sites while enjoying your adventures!

### Manoa Valley
[Pu’u Pia](https://hawaiitrails.hawaii.gov/trails/#/trail/puu-pia-trail-manoa/243): A short, low-key Mānoa Valley favorite, with excellent views of the back of the valley at the top. 

[Waahila Ridge Trail](https://hawaiitrails.hawaii.gov/trails/#/trail/waahila-ridge-trail/239): Another Mānoa favorite, which can be accessed from the Pu’u Pia Trailhead if you’re looking for a serious climb, or from a parking lot in Wa‘ahila Ridge State Park atop the ridge if you’d like nice views with less climbing. The trail follows the ridge but is well-maintained and well-trafficked with excellent views of the valley and Honolulu.

Tantalus Ridge Trail Complex: A network of trails on the Tantalus ridge with some nice views of Mānoa Valley, [some particularly pleasant breezy forest sections](https://hawaiitrails.hawaii.gov/trails/#/trail/pauoa-flats-trail/233), bamboo forests, and some views of the Pali pass and windward side. You can start at the [lower Makiki Loop](https://hawaiitrails.hawaii.gov/trails/#/trail/kanealole-trail/219) if you want a long hike, or park further up the ridge if you want to [skip right to ridge views](https://hawaiitrails.hawaii.gov/trails/#/trail/manoa-cliff-trail/223)

[Mānoa Falls](https://hawaiitrails.hawaii.gov/trails/#/trail/manoa-falls-trail/225): a short hike to a waterfall. This is a busy trail, so go very early or just before sunset for the nicest experience. Those looking for a full day hike with some elevation gain can connect this trail to the Tantalus Ridge trails. 

### Further Afield

[Koko Head](http://www.oahuhike.com/koko-head-hike): Very steep all the way, short, difficult. Great for sunrise. Bring a flashlight if you go early in the morning!

[Pali lookout](https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/oahu/regions/windward-coast/nuuanu-pali-lookout): Not so much a hike as it is a lookout spot, provides excellent views over Kāneʻohe, Kailua, and Mokoliʻi.

[Maunawili](https://hawaiitrails.hawaii.gov/trails/#/trail/maunawili-trail/193): A long but relatively flat trail along the base of the windward facing ridge. Locals like to park at one end, take an uber to the other, and hike back to their cars. The trail can be accessed from Waimanalo or just off the Pali Highway.

[Kuliouou](https://hawaiitrails.hawaii.gov/trails/#/trail/kuliouou-ridge-trail/205): A short but steep trail with spectacular views of the windward side at the top.

[Makapuu Lighthouse Trail](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/hiking/oahu/makapuu-point-lighthouse-trail/): An easy, paved stroll up to the Makapuu lighthouse, with great views of the windward (Eastern) coast of the island. Hot during the day but very pretty near sunset. Parking: Closes at dusk.

[Lanikai Pillbox Hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/kaiwa-ridge-lanikai-pillbox-trail): moderate short hike; great views of the windward side of the island; great for sunrise! Parking: will have to park on the street somewhere.

[Ka’ena Point Trail](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/hiking/oahu/kaena-point-trail/): A flat walk along the coast at the very northwestern tip of the island, with a seabird sanctuary. By late July, the Layasian albatross should be fledgling and leaving, so there may still be some stragglers. Endangered monk seals are a common sight along the coast. Can be accessed either from the North Shore or West Side, but there is no road that actually rounds this particular corner of the island. Parking: Park outside this spot because they close the road after dusk.

# Visiting Maunakea

The observatories on Maunakea are located on Hawaii Island, a short flight from Honolulu. Visitor information can be found [here](https://hilo.hawaii.edu/maunakea/visitor-information/station). Standard rental cars can make the trip to the visitor’s center. **You will need a 4-wheel drive vehicle to drive the road above the visitor’s center, and most rental car companies do not allow their vehicles past that point.** Hiking trails are available, but be aware that the summit is at 13.9k ft (4200m) and subject to high-altitude mountain conditions and is deeply significant to Native Hawaiians, so please be mindful. Stargazing is best done from the lower Visitor’s Center elevation (our eyes don’t function as well on the summit!). Observatory tours and viewing centers have not yet recovered to their pre-pandemic capacity.
